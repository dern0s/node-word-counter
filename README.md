# WELL HELLO THERE

if you're reading this... this is probably something you shouldn't care about

this is a simple word counter made on nodejs that works in a janky way

IF you're to use this thing, call the node app and throw a text after the calling, like this:

`node index.js "text I want to count with this amazing cli app because I want to"`

if it works it'll display the words and appearances

why are you here, anyways?
